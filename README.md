# Bad Webcam Viewer

This program was written for the purpose of learning to build Qt and OpenCV projects in C++. All it does is open a camera and show the image (not even doing it the right way - using OpenCV for it is very easy but it's also an overkill).

Changing the camera's settings? No way! Selecting another video device while the program is running? Forget it! Taking photos or recording videos? Haha, good joke! Resizing the window? Not even that! Oh, and it only works with Video4Linux because I use Linux.

I had fun coming up with this program though. Especially since I don't know much C++.

  - Author: The code present in this repository was written by me based on publicly available information and documentations.
  - Licensing: The respective licenses of the used components apply (in whatever way the law says they should I guess? I dunno, don't ask me.). Just respect the licenses!
  - Purpose: This project was made for my own, personal, educational use.

My intention for publishing this project on GitHub was purely technical - to share the code without resorting to manually adding project collaborators. The problem is that GitHub doesn't allow for "unlisted" repositories in the same way as, for example, YouTube allows for "unlisted" videos. I'm therefore forced to publish the repo even if I do not want to do that whatsoever (especially considering the legal issues).
